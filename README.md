"# Finvisual

Finvisual is a personal project I developed to simplify the complexity of institutional-grade financial data. The tool enables individuals like you and me to extract valuable information from SEC filings, construct custom models, and share the outcomes. 

## Features

**Extracting Financials from SEC Filings:** The tool comes with a unique feature to extract financial data from complex SEC filings.

**Reading and Annotating SEC Filings:** Finvisual allows you to read SEC filings and annotate them for future reference and analysis.

**Building Custom Models:** You can conveniently build your own financial models based on the data extracted using Finvisual.

**Sharing Analysis:** Finvisual gives you the opportunity to share your analysis with others to promote collaborative learning.
